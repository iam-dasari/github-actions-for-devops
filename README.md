# github-actions-for-devops

```
--> Github actions is a platform to automate developer workflows. CI/CD is one of the workflows.
--> When something (PR Created, Code pushed, Issue Created, PT Merged etc) happens IN or TO your repository which are called GitHub Events then automatic ACTIONS are executed in response
--> 1. Listen to Event  -> Github Events
    2. Trigger Workflow -> Github Actions

    This is Workflow

    Commit Code-->Test-->Build-->Push-->Deploy
Why Github Actions is another CI/CD tool?
1. Use same tool instead of 3rd party integration
2. Setup the pipeline is easy
3. Tool for developers (GitHub Actions will provide an environment to setup pipeline specified)
